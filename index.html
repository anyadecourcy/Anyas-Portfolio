            <h1>This is my website portfolio</h1>
                <h2>By: O. Anya De Courcy</h2>
                    <p>For my portfolio updates I decided to focus on the things that one may often forget; image sizing, 
                        meta and alt text. This is something I often forgot to do in my previous projects. Now I have a much better 
                        understanding on how this process should go, and i try to go out of my way to do this first. I also tried to fix 
                        a few things that I have gotten as feedback for these projects. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I decided to focus on theses things because two weeks is not enogugh to to do drastic changes on these three websites. 
                        All three are really big and intense websites, that would take way to long to go through absolutely everything in 
                        such short time.

            <h3>Portfolio Page</h3>
                <p>
                    This first thing I did for this project was make the index page, added a gitHub rep, and netlify page portfolio for hosting. 
                    I then quickly went for the meta title's abd meta description. After adding this i moved on to my navigation and footer. 
                    As i have said in all my previous reports, I like to get this part out the way pretty quickly. Found out how to make my buttons
                    open my three websites in new tabs. This was a good technique to add. I decided that i would not be looking at my 
                    Daily Treasures website due to the fact that i have been staring at that website for the past few weeks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After adding my nagivation and footer, i looked around for a background image. Once i added this, i went on to working on improving
                    my other websites. Once i felt satsified with my other websites i came back to the portfolio and started added the text that 
                    i had noted down during my process. 
                </p>
                <p>The last big part for this portfolio is to add responsive CSS to my portfolio index page. 
                </p>

            <h3>Rainydays-pushing-the-comfort-zone</h3>
                <p>I started off with my Rainydays Jackets website. This website needs some minor changes, that later on definitely equals 
                    to big and important changes. Here I had a look at my images and used an online compressor to make the file size as close to 
                    200 kb as possible. This to speed up loading time on my website. I wasn’t able to get all my images down to around 200 kb, but 
                    most were able to be compressed by at least 20%, and that’s better than 0. I used: 
                    <a href="https://imagecompressor.com/">Online Image Compressor</a>
                </p>
                <p>Next I moved on to giving alt text to images and unique meta titles to each page. This step is something that I now do 
                    automatically right at the start of every project. It was very easy to forget meta and alt, so I have made it a point 
                    in my head to always just do it right away now. I realized that my men’s page was missing html and CSS for displaying 
                    jackets. I added this by copying what I had done on the women’s jackets page. I had to switch out every image there to 
                    be of the men’s jackets. Every image on product page for men and women were missing alt text. This was also something 
                    that was missing on my New Arrivals page. I wanted to make a working product page with JavaScript for my Rainydays 
                    website, but I realized that I wouldn’t have enough time to focus on my Science Museum website. I had a lot of CSS, 
                    image sizing, meta titles and layout design to change up on that website.

        <div class="reportpages">
            <h3>Community-science-musuem</h3>
                <p>I started of by looking at the image sizing. There where many files that were way too big. Here I was able to get a lot of my images 
                    almost down to 200kb. I went through and also added the necessary unique meta titles. I then made sure to go through all my 
                    html files and give every image alt text. CSS for this assignment also now follows the “clean” concept better than it did before.
